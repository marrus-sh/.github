#  Contributing Guidelines  #

If you were linked to this file, it is probably because you want to contribute to a repository owned by [kibigo!](https://github.com/marrus-sh).
Instead of congratulating you for that, this file is here to give you some advice.


##  Before You Even Think About It  ##

You should take a nice humility pill and take a moment to analyse your motives for being here.
Since you are looking to contribute to an opensource project, it is *probably* either because‚ÄØ:‚Äî (1) you have an economic incentive to do so, or (2) because you hold some utopian image of people being stronger or better when they all collaborate in a shared commons.
If you fall into the latter camp, **there is a good chance you are white, and male,** *not* because white men are the only people in opensource, but because white men are the people who most strongly and fervently cling to the idea of a ‚Äúshared public commons‚Äù in the face of ever‚Äêincreasing evidence that‚ÄØ:‚Äî (a) the culture and (b) its products ‚Äî:‚ÄØof the opensource movement are neither ‚Äúshared‚Äù nor ‚Äúcommon‚Äù (we can leave the question of ‚Äúpublic‚Äù to another day).

**You should stop to consider the fact that not everybody has the same assumptions, expectations, or goals,** and this extends from little things like code style to medium things like documentation language to big things like project aims and architectural concerns.
There is a *good* chance, if you have not stopped to consider this, that through contributing, part of what you are hoping to achieve is to simply make the source code reflect yourself more; which is to say that your contribution is not about utopian public commons at all, but rather **simply about making everything all about you.**

The fact of the matter is that **software is made by humans, who belong to a culture,** and this goes for you and me and everybody else interacting with this site.
Software is both **culturally‚Äêsituated** and **a cultural product**, and like anything which can be described with those words, it comes with certain ethical responsibilities regarding dissemination, participation, appropriate use, *et cetera*, absolutely **none** of which can be handled through legal frameworks such as an opensource license.

**I hate to break it to you, opensource software developer, but the files in these repositories are texts written by (and for) human beings, and if you don‚Äôt have a critical framework on hand for dealing with texts written by (and for) human beings, I suggest you get one** because you have been *severely* misled about the work you have been doing all this time.

**I encourage you to think of the programs here¬∑in less as code and more as recipes or rituals.**
When you go around adding butter to everything because you think ‚Äúit just tastes better‚Äù, I promise you, we can all tell.


##  After You Have Thought About It  ##

I am not particularly interested in one¬∑off patches from members outside the community, for reasons which should be evident from the above.
I encourage you to reach out to me directly if you want to participate in a meaningful, lasting way.
I try to keep my contact information up¬∑to¬∑date [on my GitHub public profile](https://github.com/marrus-sh/marrus-sh); for the forseeable future this will likely be [via the Mastodon‚Äêcompatible fediverse](https://joinmastodon.org).

If your contribution is not material (i.e., not representable in bytes on a hard disk, but something more intangible, like an idea or criticism), for repositories with GitHub Discussions enabled, that may be a more suitable option.
If you have an Issue with something, feel free to file an Issue.
Be advised that if I have not seen you around, and your connection to the project or its community is not evident, I may not particularly care what you think.

You should be familiar with the [Standards of Participation](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.


##  Branches and Versions  ##

The main branch of most repositories will be called `current`; this is the code which is recommended for new users to adopt.
It is not guaranteed to be stable, only the most stable; it is not guaranteed to be complete, only the most complete.
In addition to this branch, there will (likely) be tagged releases; `current` may contain additional commits beyond the latest tagged release, but typically only in the case of documentation or metadata updates (not changes to code).

Releases take the usual three‚Äêpart decimal format used by [SemVer](https://semver.org) and other open source projects.
The terms **_version_**, **_draft_**, and **_revision_** are sometimes preferred over **_major_**, **_minor_**, and **_patch_**, and you will sometimes see them formatted as `vXdY[rZ]` or `X¬∑Y[ / revision Z]` instead of the `X.Y[.Z]` which is conventional.

Development for the next draft (major or minor) release typically occurs on the `development` branch.
Pull requests which make code changes should be sent there if one exists.


##  KIBI House Style  ##

The following documents the *basics* of the house style which I use for the bulk of my projects.
It should be enough to get you started writing and understanding the code.
You should *expect* to receive comments regarding ‚Äúthe preferred way of writing X‚Äù with any code you submit via a PR, and take these comments to heart for your next contribution.

**Regardless of language, all code should use tabs for indentation** unless the language itself makes this prohibitive.
One exception is in Markdown (including Markdown comments in other languages), in which four spaces is conventional.


###  Swift code  ###


####  Terminology  ####

The word **_object_** refers to anything with reference semantics, i.e. which conforms to `AnyObject`.
In earlier versions of Swift, this meant class instances, but the scope may expand to include e.g. actors.

The word **_value_** refers *specifically* to things with value semantics, like structs or enums.
Do not say ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in contexts where it is not known whether a given thing is or isn‚Äôt an object.

The word **_thing_** refers to both objects and values together.

If a thing doesn‚Äôt belong to another thing, it is a **_variable_**, **_constant_**, or **_function_**.
If it does, it is a (possibly **_static_**) **_property_** or **_method_**.
Properties which only have getters are **_readonly_**, and properties which only have setters (rare) are **_write¬∑only_**.

Spelling and language generally follows Canadian English, with some peculiarities.
Compound words and terms of art are written joined when doing so does not change their pronunciation under ordinary English rules (e.g. ‚Äúcontextfree‚Äù), and joined with middle dots otherwise (e.g. ‚Äúcode¬∑point‚Äù).
Words ending in double¬∑L are changed to single¬∑L when used as prefixes (e.g. ‚Äúwelformed‚Äù).


####  File structure  ####

Within each module, the file structure is as follows‚ÄØ:‚Äî

| Path | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Functions/` | Toplevel function definitions |
| `Objects/` | Reference type definitions (actors and classes) |
| `Protocols/` | Protocol definitions |
| `Values/` | Value type definitions (structs and enums) |
| `Operators.swift` | Any operators defined in this module |
| `Precedences.swift` | Operator precedences if required |

Toplevel constant or variable declarations are to be *avoided at all costs* (make them a static property on a type).

Extensions to types go in the same file as the type‚Äôs declaration, or in the place where the type‚Äôs declaration *would* go (for types declared in other modules).
Files are named based on the thing they define; append the module name for things declared in other modules.
For example, an extension to `String` should go in `Values/Swift.String.swift`.

Typealiases get their own file, organized by the aliased type.
Place extensions to an aliased type in the same file as the typealias.

Filenames may optionally be preceded by an emoji sigil, followed by a *nonbreaking* space (U+00A0).
**_Use emoji sigils to associate code with relevant documentation_**; for example if a documentation section is titled `üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Gay Shit`, one might name a file documented in that section `üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Trains.swift` (not `üöÇ Trains.swift`) to associate it with the other files so documented.
This makes it easier to operate on related sections of the code using filename globs and also makes it much easier to find the file you‚Äôre looking for in large(r) codebases.


####  Character input  ####

The allowed characters in Swift code are those in the [MacRoman character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman) plus any Emoji; these are all characters which should be available through ordinary Macintosh input methods.
(Linux users: You should be able to install a Macintosh keyboard layout on your system; I cannot help you when it comes to emoji [but recommend [fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Fcitx)].)

Exceptions to the above are allowed for‚ÄØ:‚Äî

 +  String literals
 +  Documentation comments (although *do your best*)
     +  MacRoman (very unfortunately) does not have a separate hyphen character; use hyphen‚Äêminus
 +  Identifiers, when an accepted form uses other characters (for example, identifiers in a different language)


####  Naming conventions  ####

The usual Swift naming conventions apply.
However, the names given in specifications take priority; this is especially true of grammars.
In some cases the specification name is a little more opaque or cumbersome than the common name which you might expect; oftentimes, maintaining this is important, because another specification will later redefine the common name with slightly different semantics.

The character `U+00B7 ¬∑ MIDDLE DOT` is used in place of a hyphen; the following letter is not capitalized.
It is also used in abbreviations in place of Swift‚Äôs more idiomatic ‚Äúwrite all the letters with the same case‚Äù convention; in this case, the following letter *is* capitalized.


#####  middot names  #####

When a property, function, or method implements an algorithm explicitly provided for by a specification, describes a value, or otherwise forms a core part of the set of expected interactions within an API, its name will be written surrounded by middle dots, like `¬∑this¬∑`.
Most properties, functions, and methods will take this form.
A middle dot is **not** used in the following cases‚ÄØ:‚Äî

 +  Names of types or specific values (e.g. enum cases)
 +  ‚ÄúConstructor‚Äù static methods
 +  Simple conversions between types (e.g. `.string` or `.int` computed properties)
 +  Properties or methods required for protocol conformance, which are used to derive more regular APIs
 +  Implementation of native Swift APIs like `CustomStringConvertible` (for obvious reasons)

Outside of protocol implementations, you should *always* use middot methods where available; they are the preferred means of interacting with code.


#####  emoji  #####

Emoji may be used in non‚Äêpublic identifiers *only*.
The emoji `üôà`, `üôâ`, `üôä` are used to denote changes in access control, signifying private, fileprivate, and internal, respectively.
If an internal property or method is `@usableFromInline`, this may be indicated with a `üêµ` emoji instead.
It is *recommended* that constants and variables declared in the body of a function use an emoji in their name, to distinguish them from properties and parameters.
Because such variables cannot escape the narrow context in which they are defined, ambiguity is generally not an issue here.

The following are broad emoji conventions for use in such contexts‚ÄØ:‚Äî

| Codepoint(s) | Emoji | Meaning |
| --: | :-: | :-: |
| `U+2319,U+FE0F` | `‚ÑπÔ∏è` | Index |
| `U+303D,U+FE0F` | `„ÄΩÔ∏è` | Mutable; variable |
| `U+1F192` | `üÜí` | A processed or normalized thing |
| `U+1F194` | `üÜî` | Identifier; especially an IRI |
| `U+1F195` | `üÜï` | A newly‚Äêcreated thing |
| `U+1F196` | `üÜñ` | No good; failure |
| `U+1F197` | `üÜó` | OK; success |
| `U+1F198` | `üÜò` | Unsafe |
| `U+1F199` | `üÜô` | Currently up; a value to process |
| `U+1F201` | `üàÅ` | ‚ÄúHere‚Äù; the current value in an iteration/loop |
| `U+1F310` | `üåê` | Localized |
| `U+1F3B1` | `üé±` | Foo |
| `U+1F4C1` | `üìÅ` | Wrapped |
| `U+1F4C2` | `üìÇ` | Unwrapped |
| `U+1F435` | `üêµ` | `@usableFromInline internal` |
| `U+1F4B0` | `üí∞` | Thing accessed by a key |
| `U+1F4B1` | `üí±` | A typecast or conversion |
| `U+1F4DB` | `üìõ` | Name |
| `U+1F4DE` | `üìû` | Callback |
| `U+1F4E5` | `üì•` | An accumulator |
| `U+1F4E4` | `üì§` | An iterator |
| `U+1F511` | `üîë` | Key |
| `U+1F519` | `üîô` | The return thing of an operation |
| `U+1F51A` | `üîö` | A last thing |
| `U+1F51B` | `üîõ` | A range |
| `U+1F51C` | `üîú` | A forthcoming result |
| `U+1F51A` | `üîù` | A first thing |
| `U+1F5C4` | `üóÑ` | Storage |
| `U+1F648` | `üôà` | `private` |
| `U+1F649` | `üôâ` | `fileprivate` |
| `U+1F64A` | `üôä` | `internal` |
| `U+1F91B` | `ü§õ` | Righthand |
| `U+1F91C` | `ü§ú` | Lefthand |
| `U+1F9F1` | `üß±` | Component |

‚Äî:‚ÄØbut be aware that these are just guidelines.
If the meaning of an emoji is not clear from its surrounding context, it probably means you need to refactor your code!

Emoji may be used as operators *even in public code* (where the Swift lexical grammar allows).

**Be aware that some emoji include an invisible VS-16 codepoint (`U+FE0F`).**


####  Documentation  ###

Documentation of public symbols should generally follow [ordinary DocC conventions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc).
(Documentation of private symbols should too, but it‚Äôs less important.)
Note that, at time of writing, DocC does not play particularly well with non¬∑A¬∑S¬∑C¬∑I¬∑I characters, so you may have to do some investigative work to find out how to refer to things.
When the symbol link and symbol name differ, formatting links like ``[`¬∑foo¬∑`](doc:_foo_)`` is preferred for clarity.

The first instance of a symbol should be linked, *per section*.
(Consider Parameters/Returns/Throws items each to be their own section.)
Do not link the symbol currently being defined.
Remaining instances need not be linked.

A termlist should be placed in the Overview section, before the first subheading (or at the end of the section if there are no subheadings).
The following terms should be defined‚ÄØ:‚Äî

| Term | Meaning | Required for‚Ä¶ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Framework version` | The version of the framework being documented | Landing pages |
| `Maintainer(s)` | The current maintainer(s) of the framework | Landing pages |
| `Source repository` | A link to the source repository for the framework | Landing pages |
| `Specification(s)` | Links to one or more relevant specifications which define the implemented behaviours | Anything which implements an external specification |
| `Available since` | The version of the API when this symbol was first made public | Public symbols |
| `Author(s)` | Individuals who contributed to the implementation of this symbol | Functions, methods, and computed symbols (anything which is defined using a closure) |
| `Complexity` | How much ‚Äútime‚Äù the algorithm takes; e.g. O(n) | Anything which cannot be solved in constant time |


###  Other code languages  ###

There are no explicit conventions; try to match existing code.
